## IPL Matches Data Analysis Using MS Excel 
 I delved into the rich history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to create a comprehensive data analysis dashboard. From exploring match outcomes based on batting or fielding first to visualizing top performers and venues, this project showcases how powerful insights can be drawn from detailed data analysis.

### Key highlights include:
- Team Performance:
   A deep dive into win patterns, whether batting or fielding first.
- Title Winners & Top Performers:
   Visual breakdowns of title victories and the most prolific Man of the Match award winners.
- Venue Analysis:
  Insight into the top venues and their influence on match outcomes.

This project not only sharpened my Excel skills but also deepened my understanding of data-driven decision-making.
